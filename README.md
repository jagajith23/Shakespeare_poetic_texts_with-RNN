# Shakespeare_poetic_texts_with-RNN
<p>This is a fun project that uses LSTM to generate Shakespeare's Sonnets as well as the play text on its own.</p>
<h2>Technology used:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Tensorflow</li>
</ol>
<p>I saved my model, so there is no need to retrain it; but, if you want to retrain it, that is entirely up to you.</p>
<p>I've included the dataset that was used in this programme. </p>
